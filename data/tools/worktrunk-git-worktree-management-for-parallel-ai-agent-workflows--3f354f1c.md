Worktrunk is a CLI for Git worktree management, designed for **parallel AI agent
workflows**.

Worktrunk’s three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches.
Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working
with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows &
copy-on-write build caches.

A quick demo:

Listing worktrees, switching, cleaning up

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it’s possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git’s native
worktree feature gives each agent its own working directory, so they don’t step
on each other’s changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template. Commands that take a branch also accept the path of the worktree it is checked out in.

Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

| Task | Worktrunk | Plain git |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Switch worktrees | `wt switch feat` | `cd ../repo.feat` |
| Create + start Claude | `wt switch -c -x claude feat` | `git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat && \<br>cd ../repo.feat && \<br>claude` |
| Clean up | `wt remove` | `cd ../repo && \<br>git worktree remove ../repo.feat && \<br>git branch -d feat` |
| List with status | `wt list` | `git worktree list` (paths only) |

Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

**Workflow automation:**

- [**Hooks**](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- [**LLM commit messages**](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) — generate commit messages from diffs
- [**Merge workflow**](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/) — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- [**Interactive picker**](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/#interactive-picker) — browse worktrees with streaming CI status and diff, log, PR and comment previews
- [**Share build caches**](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-copy-ignored) — ten worktrees get `target/`, `node_modules/`, etc without building or copying them (on APFS, btrfs, and XFS)
- [**`wt list --full`**](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#full-mode) — [CI status](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#ci-status) and [AI-generated summaries](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#llm-summaries) per branch
- [**PR checkout**](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/#pull-requests-and-merge-requests) — `wt switch pr:123` to jump straight to a PR’s branch
- [**Dev server per worktree**](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#dev-server-per-worktree) — `hash_port` template filter gives each worktree a unique port
- [**Aliases**](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases)** & **[**per-branch variables**](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars) — custom `wt <name>` commands and branch-scoped state for hook templates
- …and [**lots more**](https://worktrunk.dev/#next-steps)

Multiple parallel agents, same simple commands:

**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**



```plain text
brewinstallworktrunk &&wtconfigshellinstall
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**



```plain text
cargoinstallworktrunk &&wtconfigshellinstall
```

****Windows & other****

Create a worktree for a new feature:



```plain text
wtswitch--createfeature-auth
✓ Created branchfeature-auth frommain and worktree @~/repo.feature-auth
```

This creates a new branch and worktree, then switches to it. Do your work, then check all worktrees with [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/):



```plain text
wtlist
Branch        Status      HEAD±     main↕    main…±    Remote⇅  Commit    Age  Message
@ feature-auth  +   ↑      +27   -8   ↑1       +31                4bc72dc    2h  Add authenticatio…
^ main              ^⇡                                    ⇡1      0e631ad    1d  Initial commit
○ Showing 2 worktrees, 1 with changes, 1 ahead, hidden: Path
```

The `@` marks the current worktree. `+` means staged changes, `↑1` means 1 commit ahead of main, `⇡` means unpushed commits.

When done, either:

**PR workflow** — commit, push, open a PR, merge via GitHub/GitLab, then clean up:



```plain text
wtstepcommit# commit staged changes
ghprcreate# or glab mr create
wtremove# after PR is merged
```

**Local merge** — squash, rebase onto main, fast-forward merge, clean up:



```plain text
wtmergemain
◎ Generating commit message and committing changes...(2 files,+53, no squashing needed)
 Add authentication module
✓ Committed changes @a1b2c3d
◎ Merging 1 commit tomain @a1b2c3d (no rebase needed)
 * a1b2c3d Add authentication module
  auth.rs | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  lib.rs  |  2 ++
  2 files changed, 53 insertions(+)
✓ Merged tomain(1 commit, 2 files,+53)
◎ Removingfeature-auth worktree & branch in background (same commit asmain, _)
○ Switched to worktree for main @ ~/repo
```

For parallel agents, create multiple worktrees and launch an agent in each:



```plain text
wtswitch-xclaude-cfeature-a--'Add user authentication'
wtswitch-xclaude-cfeature-b--'Fix the pagination bug'
wtswitch-xclaude-cfeature-c--'Write tests for the API'
```

The `-x` flag runs a command after switching; arguments after `--` are passed to it. Configure [post-start hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) to automate setup (install deps, start dev servers).
