# syntaqlite

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LalitMaganti/syntaqlite/main/web/docs/static/favicon.svg)

A parser, formatter, validator, and language server for SQLite SQL, built on SQLite's own grammar and tokenizer. If SQLite accepts it, syntaqlite parses it. If SQLite rejects it, so does syntaqlite.

[**Docs**](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/) · [**Playground**](https://playground.syntaqlite.com/) · [**VS Code Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=syntaqlite.syntaqlite)

## Why syntaqlite

Most SQLite tools build a generic SQL parser and bolt SQLite on as a "flavor" with hand-written grammars, regex-based tokenizers, or subsets that approximate the language. That falls apart because SQLite has a deep surface area of syntax that generic parsers don't handle.

syntaqlite uses SQLite's own [Lemon-generated grammar](https://www.sqlite.org/lemon.html) and tokenizer, compiled from C. The parser doesn't approximate SQLite; it _is_ SQLite's grammar compiled into a reusable library.

SQLite SQL is also not one fixed language. It has [22 compile-time flags](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html) that change what syntax the parser accepts, another 12 that gate built-in functions, and the language evolves across versions. Because SQLite is embedded, you can't assume everyone is on the latest version (Android 15 ships SQLite 3.44.3, seven major versions behind latest). syntaqlite tracks all of this:

```plain text
syntaqlite --sqlite-version 3.32.0 validate \
  -e "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1 RETURNING *;"
```

```plain text
error: syntax error near 'RETURNING'
 --> <stdin>:1:32
  |
1 | DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1 RETURNING *;
  |                                ^~~~~~~~~
```

`RETURNING` was added in SQLite 3.35.0; Android 13 still ships SQLite 3.32.2.

We've tested against ~396K statements from [SQLite's upstream test suite](https://sqlite.org/testing.html) with ~99.7% agreement on parse acceptance. See the [detailed comparison](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/reference/comparison/) for how syntaqlite stacks up against other tools.

## What it does

### Validate ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/concepts/validation/))

Finds unknown tables, columns, and functions against your schema, the same errors `sqlite3_prepare` would catch but without needing a database. Unlike `sqlite3`, syntaqlite finds **all** errors in one pass:

```plain text
CREATE TABLE orders (id, status, total, created_at);

WITH
  monthly_stats(month, revenue, order_count) AS (
    SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', o.created_at), SUM(o.total)
    FROM orders o WHERE o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', o.created_at)
  )
SELECT ms.month, ms.revenue, ms.order_count,
  ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count, 2) AS avg_order
FROM monthly_stats ms;
```

**sqlite3** stops at the first error and misses the function typo entirely:

```plain text
Error: in prepare, table monthly_stats has 2 values for 3 columns
```

**syntaqlite** finds both the CTE column count mismatch and the `ROUDN` typo, with source locations and suggestions:

```plain text
error: table 'monthly_stats' has 2 values for 3 columns
  |
2 | monthly_stats(month, revenue,
  | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

warning: unknown function 'ROUDN'
   |
14 | ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count,
   | ^~~~~
   = help: did you mean 'round'?
```

### Format ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/reference/cli/#fmt))

Deterministic formatting with configurable line width, keyword casing, and indentation:

```plain text
echo "select u.id,u.name, p.title from users u join posts p on u.id=p.user_id
where u.active=1 and p.published=true order by p.created_at desc limit 10" \
  | syntaqlite fmt
```

```plain text
SELECT u.id, u.name, p.title
FROM users u
  JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.active = 1
  AND p.published = true
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Version and compile-flag aware ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/guides/version-pinning/))

Pin the parser to a specific SQLite version or enable [compile-time flags](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html) to match your exact build:

```plain text
# Reject syntax your target SQLite version doesn't support
syntaqlite --sqlite-version 3.32.0 validate query.sql

# Enable optional syntax from compile-time flags
syntaqlite --sqlite-cflag SQLITE_ENABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS validate query.sql
```

### Validate SQL inside other languages _(experimental)_

SQL lives inside Python and TypeScript strings in most real codebases. syntaqlite extracts and validates it, handling interpolation holes:

```plain text
# app.py
def get_user_stats(user_id: int):
    return conn.execute(
        f"SELECT nme, ROUDN(score, 2) FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    )
```

```plain text
syntaqlite validate --experimental-lang python app.py
```

```plain text
warning: unknown function 'ROUDN'
 --> app.py:3:23
  |
3 |         f"SELECT nme, ROUDN(score, 2) FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
  |                       ^~~~~
  = help: did you mean 'round'?
```

### Project configuration

Create a `syntaqlite.toml` in your project root to configure schemas and formatting. The LSP, CLI, and all editor integrations read it automatically:

```plain text
# Map SQL files to schema DDL files for validation and completions.
[schemas]
"src/**/*.sql" = ["schema/main.sql", "schema/views.sql"]
"tests/**/*.sql" = ["schema/main.sql", "schema/test_fixtures.sql"]
"migrations/*.sql" = []  # no schema validation for migrations

# Default schema for SQL files that don't match any glob above.
# schema = ["schema.sql"]

# Formatting options (all optional, shown with defaults).
[format]
line-width = 80
indent-width = 2
keyword-case = "upper"    # "upper" | "lower"
semicolons = true
```

The config file is discovered by walking up from the file being processed, same as `rustfmt.toml` or `ruff.toml`. CLI flags override config file values.

### Editor integration ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/getting-started/vscode/))

Full language server with no database connection required. Diagnostics, format on save, completions, and semantic highlighting.

**VS Code** — install the [syntaqlite extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=syntaqlite.syntaqlite) from the marketplace.

[**Other editors**](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/getting-started/other-editors/) — point your LSP client at:

```plain text
syntaqlite lsp
```

**Claude Code** — `claude plugin install syntaqlite@lalitmaganti-plugins` ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/getting-started/claude-code/))

### Parse ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/guides/parsing/))

Full abstract syntax tree with side tables for tokens, comments, and whitespace, for code generation, migration tooling, or static analysis.

```plain text
syntaqlite parse -e "SELECT 1 + 2"
```

```

## Use as a library ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/integrating/))

**Rust** ([API docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/integrating/rust-api/))

```plain text
[dependencies]
syntaqlite = { version = "0.2.15", features = ["fmt"] }
```

**Python** ([API docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/reference/python-api/))

```plain text
pip install syntaqlite
```

**JavaScript / WASM** ([API docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/reference/js-api/))

```plain text
npm install syntaqlite
```

**C** — the parser, tokenizer, formatter, and validator all have C APIs. See the [C API docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/reference/c-api/).

## Architecture ([docs](https://docs.syntaqlite.com/main/contributing/architecture/))

The parser and tokenizer are written in C, directly wrapping SQLite's own grammar. Everything else (formatter, validator, LSP) is written in Rust with C bindings available.

The split is intentional. The C parser is as portable as SQLite itself: it can run inside database engines, embedded systems, or anywhere SQLite runs. The Rust layer moves fast for developer tooling where the standard library and crate ecosystem matter.
