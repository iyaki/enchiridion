It starts innocently.

You rename a batch of files with a ten-line Python script, or you alias a common `git` command to shave off two keystrokes. Maybe you build a small shell function to format JSON from the clipboard.

You’re not even trying to be clever. You’re just solving tiny problems. Making the machine do what it should have done in the first place. And then something happens. You cross a _threshold_. You look at your tools, your environment, your operating system—even your editor—and suddenly **everything** is fair game.

You _could_ rebuild that (if you wanted to).

You could _improve_ that (if you wanted to).

Then someone challenges you. As banter maybe, perhaps jokingly but also with a dash of hope. Then the air in the room changes.

It suddenly becomes something else. It becomes:

You _should_.

And from that moment forward, the world is broken in new and specific ways that only _you_ can see.

## Technical Capability as a Moral Weight

Before I could program, broken software was frustrating but ignorable. For years I’ve simply “used” a computer, as a consumer. I was what companies were concerned with tricking into buying their products, or subscribing to their services. Not the technical geek that they prefer to avoid with their software releases, or banning from their games based on an OS.

Now it has become _provocative_. I can see the patterns that I wish I couldn’t, find oversights that I can attribute to a certain understanding (or the lack thereof) of a certain concept and I can _hear_ what has been echoing in the head of the computer illiterate person who conjured the program I have to debug.

I notice flaws like a good surgeon notices a limp.

Why the _hell_ does this site send ten megabytes of JavaScript for a static page?

Why is the CLI output not parseable by `awk`?

Why is this config hardcoded when it could be declarative?

Those things are _not_ just questions, they are _accusations_. And, unfortunately, they do not stop.

Now that I’ve learned to notice, my perception of software has changed in its entirety.

Every piece of software becomes a TODO list.

Every system becomes a scaffolding for a better one.

Every inconvenience becomes an indictment of inaction.

## One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy

Like Camus’ Sisyphus, we are condemned to push the boulder of our own systems uphill—one fix, one refactor, one script at a time. But unlike the story of Sisyphus, the curse is not placed onto you by some god. We built the boulder ourselves. And we keep polishing it on the way up.

I’ve lost count of how many projects I have started that began with some variation of “Yeah, I could build this _but better_.”

- A static site generator because the existing ones had too many opinions.
- A note-taking tool because I didn’t like the way others structured metadata.
- A CLI task runner because Make is cryptic and Taskfile is YAML hell.
- A personal wiki engine in Rust, then in Go, then in Nim, then back to Markdown.
- A homelab dashboard because I don’t like webslop.

The list continues, and trust me it _does_ continue. My dev directory, as it stands, is nearing 30 gigabytes.

If you ask me, I was solving real, innocent problems. But in hindsight, I was also feeding something else: a compulsion to assert control. Every new tool I built was a sandbox I _owned_: No weird bugs. No legacy constraints. No decisions I didn’t entirely agree with. Until, of course, I became the legacy.

Kafka once wrote that “**a cage went in search of a bird**.” [1](https://notashelf.dev/posts/curse-of-knowing#user-content-fn-1) That is what these projects can become. Empty systems we keep building, waiting for purpose, for clarity, for… salvation? I’m not sure how else would you call this pursuit.

## Entropy Is Undefeated

Now let’s go back. Back to when we didn’t know better.

Software doesn’t stay solved. Every solution you write starts to rot the moment it exists. Not now, not later, but eventually. Libraries deprecate. APIs change. Performance regressions creep in. Your once-perfect tool breaks silently because `libfoo.so` is now `libfoo.so.2`. [2](https://notashelf.dev/posts/curse-of-knowing#user-content-fn-2)

I _have_ had scripts silently fail because a website changed its HTML layout.

I _have_ had configuration formats break because of upstream version bumps.

I _have_ had Docker containers die because Alpine Linux rotated a mirror URL.

In each case, the immediate emotional response was not just inconvenience but something that moreso resembles _guilt_. I built this, and I do know better. How could I not have foreseen this? Time to fix it.

If you replace every part of the system over time, is it still the same tool? Does it still serve the same purpose? Do _you_?

## The Illusion of Finality

I think we lie to ourselves.

> “If I just get this setup right, I’ll never have to touch it again."

"If I just write this one tool, my workflow will be seamless."

"If I automate this, I’ll save time forever.” [3](https://notashelf.dev/posts/curse-of-knowing#user-content-fn-3)

“Write once, run everywhere.” My ass.

It is, I admit, a seductive lie. It frames programming as a conquest of sorts. A series of battles you win, or challenges you complete. But the imaginary war never ends. You don’t build a castle. You dig trenches. And they flood every time it rains. The trials are _never_ complete.

## Technical Work as Emotional Regulation

On the theme of filling this post with literary references, let me quote the Stoic Marcus Aurelius.

> You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

But programming lures us into believing we _can_ control the outside events. That is where the suffering begins. There is something deeper happening here. This is _not_ just about software.

I believe sometimes building things is how we self-soothe. We write a new tool or a script because we are in a desperate need for a small victory. We write a new tool because we are overwhelmed. Refactor it, not because the code is messy, but your life is. We chase the perfect system because it gives us something to hold onto when everything else is spinning. This is the lesson I’ve taken from using NixOS.

I have written entire applications just to avoid thinking about why I was unhappy. Programming gives you instant feedback. You run the thing, and it works. Or it _doesn’t_, and you fix it. Either way, you’re _doing something_.

That kind of agency is addictive. Especially when the rest of life doesn’t offer it. We program because we _can_, even when we shouldn’t. Because at least it gives us something to rebel against.

## The Burnout You Don’t See Coming

Burnout doesn not just come from overwork. It comes from _overresponsibility_.

And programming, once internalized deeply enough, makes everything feel like your responsibility. The bloated website. The inefficient script. The clunky onboarding process at your job. You _could_ fix it. So why aren’t you?

The truth you are very well aware of is that you can’t fix it all. You _know_ this, you always knew it regardless of your level of skill. But try telling that to the part of your brain that sees every inefficiency as a moral failing.

Nietzsche warned of gazing too long into the abyss. But he didn _not_ warn what happens when the abyss is a `Makefile` or a 30k line of code Typescript project.

## Learning to Let Go

So where is the exit? Is this akin to Sartre’s depiction of hell, where hell _is_ other people and how they interact with your software? Or is it some weird backwards hell where people create software that you have to interact with?

The first step is recognizing that _not everything broken is yours to fix_.

Not every tool needs replacing.

Not every bad experience is a call to action.

Sometimes, it’s OK to just _use_ the thing. Sometimes it’s enough to know _why_ it’s broken—even if you don’t fix it. Sometimes the most disciplined thing you can do is _walk away_ from the problem you know how to solve. There’s a kind of strength in that.

Not apathy, no. Nor laziness. Just… some restraint.

## A New Kind of Skill

What if the real skill isn’t technical mastery? Or better yet what if it’s emotional clarity?

- Knowing which problems are worth your energy.
- Knowing which projects are worth maintaining.
- Knowing when you’re building to help—and when you’re building to cope.
- Knowing when to stop.

This is what I’m trying to learn now. After the excitement. After the obsession. After the burnout. I’m trying to let things stay a little broken. Because I’ve realized I don’t want to _fix everything_. I just want to feel OK in a world that often isn’t. I can fix something, but not everything.

You learn how to program. You learn how to fix things. But the hardest thing you’ll ever learn is when to _leave them broken_.

And maybe that’s the most human skill of all.
