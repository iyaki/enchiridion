## Smol Responsive CSS Grid

Section titled Smol Responsive CSS Grid

- grid
- layout

Create an intrinsically responsive grid layout, optionally using a CSS custom property to extend to variable contexts. Each column will resize at the same rate, and items will begin to break to a new row if the width reaches the --min value.

CSS for "Smol Responsive CSS Grid"

```plain text
.smol-css-grid { --min: 15ch; --gap: 1rem; display: grid; grid-gap: var(--gap); /* min() with 100% prevents overflow in extra narrow spaces */ grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, var(--min)), 1fr)); }
```

## Smol Intrinsic Container

Section titled Smol Intrinsic Container

- utility
- layout

This modern CSS container recipe has three delicious ingredients: the min() function, the logical property margin-inline, and a custom property - --container-max - to make it flexible across infinite contexts.

Logical properties are writing mode-aware properties that can also serve as shorthand in some cases. Here, margin-inline is a shorthand for setting both margin-left and margin-right, and margin-inline has fairly good support. A PostCSS plugin is available if you're unable to upgrade quite yet for your audience.

Review the "Smol Flexible Unbreakable Boxes" for an explanation of min(),

CSS for "Smol Intrinsic Container"

```plain text
.smol-container { width: min(100% - 3rem, var(--container-max, 60ch)); margin-inline: auto; }

## Smol Breakout Grid

Section titled Smol Breakout Grid

- grid
- layout

Setup a flexible grid layout with collapsing outer columns for easy placement of "breakout" elements.

The first feature is the use of the [x-start]/[x-end] syntax to create named grid areas that span more than one column (also works for rows!). In this example, we create three columns where the grid area spans all three, and the content area is the center column.

Next, we've set the outer column widths to 1fr and those columns will collapse first to give the minmax() definition for the center column priority, meaning they will eventually compute to a width of 0. Important to note is that we're only setting row gap, otherwise any column gap would keep space propped open between the middle and outer columns. The minmax() definition is explained in the demo for the Smol Responsive Grid.

Finally, we assign everything that doesn't have the special .breakout class to the content named area, and the .breakout to the grid named area. Be sure to resize the demo to see the outer columns collapse to contain the breakout!

CSS for "Smol Breakout Grid"

```plain text
.smol-breakout-grid { --max-content-width: 50ch; --breakout-difference: 0.2; /* Compute total allowed grid width to `--breakout-difference` larger than content area */ --breakout-grid-width: calc( var(--max-content-width) + (var(--max-content-width) * var(--breakout-difference)) ); display: grid; grid-template-columns: [grid-start] 1fr [content-start] minmax( min(100%, var(--max-content-width)), 1fr ) [content-end] 1fr [grid-end]; width: min(100% - 2rem, var(--breakout-grid-width)); row-gap: 1rem; margin: 5vb auto; } .smol-breakout-grid > *:not(.breakout) { grid-column: content; } .smol-breakout-grid > .breakout { grid-column: grid; }
```

## Smol Stack Layout

Section titled Smol Stack Layout

- grid
- layout

This smol stacked layout is a grid feature that can often replace older techniques that relied on absolute positioning. It works by defining a single grid-template-area and then assigning all direct children to that grid-area. The children are then "stacked" and can take advantage of grid positioning, such as the centering technique in the demo.

At first glance you might not notice, but that's a video background in the demo. And all we had to do was set width: 100% to ensure it filled the grid area. Then, we make use of place-self on the h3 to center it. The rest is completely optional design styling!

Bonus features in this demo include defining the h3 size using clamp() for viewport relative sizing, and also using aspect-ratio to size the container to help reduce cumulative layout shift.

CSS for "Smol Stack Layout"

```plain text
.smol-stack-layout { display: grid; grid-template-areas: "stack"; /* Set within the HTML for the demo */ aspect-ratio: var(--stack-aspect-ratio); background-color: #200070; } .smol-stack-layout > * { grid-area: stack; } .smol-stack-layout video { width: 100%; } .smol-stack-layout h3 { place-self: center; font-size: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 5rem); text-align: center; line-height: 1; font-style: italic; padding: 5vh 2vw; } .smol-stack-layout--video small { align-self: end; justify-self: start; padding: 0 0 0.25em 0.5em; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 0.8rem; } .smol-stack-layout h3, .smol-stack-layout small { position: relative; color: #fff; }
```

## Smol Responsive Padding

Section titled Smol Responsive Padding

- layout

This smol demo is using clamp() for responsive padding. The order of clamp() values can be interpreted as: the minimum allowed value is 1rem, the ideal value is 5% (which will be relative to the element), and the max allowed value is 3rem.

In other words, as the element is placed in different contexts and resized across viewports, that value will grow and shrink. But it will always compute to a value within the range of 1rem to 3rem.

Another suggested option for the middle ideal value is to use a viewport unit, like 4vw, which works great for components such as models or setting padding on the body.

CSS for "Smol Responsive Padding"

```plain text
.smol-responsive-padding { padding: 1.5rem clamp(1rem, 5%, 3rem); }
```

- layout

Several layers of delicious modern CSS goodness here! First, we're using fit-content to handle the sidebar sizing. This allows the sidebar to grow up to the defined value, but only if it needs to, else it will use/shrink to the equivalent of min-content.

Next, we use minmax for the main content. Why? Because if we only use 1fr then eventually our sidebar and main will share 50% of the space, and we want the main area to always be wider. We also nest min to ask the browser to use the minimum of either of the options. The result in this case is use of 50vw on mobile-sized viewports, and 30ch on larger viewports. And, when there's room, it also stretches to 1fr for the max part of minmax 🙌🏽

CSS for "Smol Responsive Sidebar Layout"

```plain text
.smol-sidebar { display: grid; grid-template-columns: fit-content(20ch) minmax(min(50vw, 30ch), 1fr); }
```

## Smol Aspect Ratio Gallery

Section titled Smol Aspect Ratio Gallery

- flexbox
- layout
- component

The aspect-ratio property has support in all major modern browsers, and by combining it with object-fit and flexbox, we can create a smol responsive gallery. Check out the CSS via your browser Inspector to modify the CSS custom properties on .smol-aspect-ratio-gallery and see how they affect this layout.

The demo initially sets a height as a fallback for browsers that do not yet support aspect-ratio, and then uses @supports to upgrade to use of aspect-ratio.

Note that aspect-ratio isn't just for images, but any element!

> This solution also uses the Smol Responsive Flexbox Grid.

CSS for "Smol Aspect Ratio Gallery"

```plain text
.smol-aspect-ratio-gallery { --min: 15rem; --aspect-ratio: 4/3; --gap: 0; } .smol-aspect-ratio-gallery li { height: max(25vh, 15rem); } @supports (aspect-ratio: 1) { .smol-aspect-ratio-gallery li { aspect-ratio: var(--aspect-ratio); height: auto; } } .smol-aspect-ratio-gallery img { display: block; object-fit: cover; width: 100%; height: 100%; }
```

## Smol Flexible Unbreakable Boxes

Section titled Smol Flexible Unbreakable Boxes

- component
- layout

CSS is awesome, and using a mix of older and modern CSS we can quickly define flexible, unbreakable boxes!

This demo of a blockquote first reuses our responsive padding idea to enable padding that just feels right as the box flexes to different sizes. The box size is controlled by setting width using the min() function. As the box grows and shrinks, min() will select the minimum of the provided values, resulting in a box that has a max-width for large viewports and a max-width on smaller viewports.

Then we add a few properties to ensure long text values cannot break the box, including word-break and hyphens (note that hyphens may not work in all languages).

Finally, the footer sets its width with fit-content just as we also used in the previous visited styles demo. This makes for a great alternative to swapping to an inline display value in case you also need to set a display!

CSS for "Smol Flexible Unbreakable Boxes"

```plain text
.smol-unbreakable-box { --color-light: #E0D4F6; --color-dark: #675883; margin: 2rem auto; color: var(--color-dark); background-color: var(--color-light); font-size: 1.15rem; /* Smol Responsive Padding FTW! */ padding: clamp(.75rem, 3%, 2rem); /* Provide a max-width and prevent overflow */ width: min(50ch, 90%); /* Help prevent overflow of long words/names/URLs */ word-break: break-word; /* Optional, not supported for all languages */ hyphens: auto; } .smol-unbreakable-box footer { padding: 0.25em 0.5em; margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--color-light); background-color: var(--color-dark); font-size: 0.9rem; /* Creates a visual box shrunk to `max-content` */ width: fit-content; }
```

## Smol Background Picture

Section titled Smol Background Picture

- grid
- component

We can reuse the Smol Stack to enable layering the <picture> element with content as a replacement for using background-image. This will let you get the performance benefits of modern image formats like WebP, as well as being able to define alt text for accessibility.

If you haven't worked with the picture element before, note that you apply image-related CSS to the internal img element.

To emulate background-image type of behavior, we use object-fit: cover just like we also used for the image gallery.

Bonus technique: improve text contrast of the overlaid content by applying filter to the img. With the filter, we reduce brightness to darken the image while also increasing the saturate value to recuperate some of the image vibrancy. These are set with custom properties so that you can easily modify them per-instance if needed to ensure the best contrast.

> This solution also uses the Smol Stack Layout.

CSS for "Smol Background Picture"

```plain text
.smol-background-picture img { --background-img-brightness: 0.45; --background-img-saturate: 1.25; object-fit: cover; width: 100%; height: 100%; /* decrease brightness to improve text contrast */ filter: brightness(var(--background-img-brightness)) saturate(var(--background-img-saturate)); } /* Necessary if not already within a reset */ .smol-background-picture :is(img, picture) { display: block; } .smol-background-picture__content { /* ensure stacking context above the picture */ position: relative; align-self: center; color: #fff; text-align: center; padding: 1rem; } .smol-background-picture__content p { font-size: clamp(1.35rem, 5vw, 1.75rem); line-height: 1.3; }
```

## Smol Composable Card Component

Section titled Smol Composable Card Component

- grid
- flexbox
- component

This component features aspect-ratio and leans heavily on the pseudo selectors of :not(), :first-child, and :last-child. The result is a composable card component that just works with your desired semantic internal content.

With CSS Selectors Level 4, the enhanced version of :not() now allows a selector list. This ability is fairly well supported in modern browsers.

A tiny modern CSS progressive enhancement is the use of text-wrap: pretty which prevents typography "orphans" by evaluating the last four lines in a text block and makes adjustments so the last line has two or more words.

Note: You may need to create fallbacks for aspect-ratio for your unique audience and consider this solution as a progressive enhancement. Review the Smol Aspect Ratio Gallery for one method of creating a fallback.

> This solution also uses the Smol Responsive CSS Grid to contain the cards.

CSS for "Smol Composable Card Component"

```plain text
.smol-card-component { --img-ratio: 3/2; display: flex; flex-direction: column; /* Supported for flexbox in modern browsers since April 2021 */ gap: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 0 0.5rem hsl(0 0% 0% / 35%); border-radius: 0.5rem; } .smol-card-component > img { aspect-ratio: var(--img-ratio); object-fit: cover; width: 100%; } .smol-card-component > img:first-child { border-radius: 0.5rem 0.5rem 0 0; } .smol-card-component > img:last-child { border-radius: 0 0 0.5rem 0.5rem; margin-top: auto; } .smol-card-component > :not(img) { margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem; /* Prevent typography "orphans" */ text-wrap: pretty; } .smol-card-component > :not(img):first-child { margin-top: 1rem; } /* Enhanced `:not()` accepts a selector list, but as a fallback you can chain `:not()` instead */ .smol-card-component > :last-of-type:not(img, h2, h3, h4) { margin-bottom: 1rem; } .smol-card-component > :not(h2, h3, h4) { font-size: 0.9rem; } .smol-card-component > a { align-self: start; }

## Smol Avatar List Component

Section titled Smol Avatar List Component

- grid
- layout
- component

This smol component, which you may also know as a facepile, is possible due to the ability of CSS grid to easily create overlapping content. Paired with CSS custom properties and calc() we can make this a contextually resizable component.

Based on devices capabilities, the grid columns are adjusted to slightly narrower than the --avatar-size. Since nothing inherent to CSS grid stops the content overflowing, it forces an overlap based on DOM order of the list items. To ensure perfect circle images, we first use the --avatar-size value to explicitly set the list item dimensions. Then by setting both width and height to 100% on the img in addition to object-fit: cover and border-radius: 50%, we can be assured that regardless of actual image dimensions the contents will be forced into a circle appearance.

Bonus trick #1 is the use of layered box-shadow values that only set a spread to create the appearance of borders without adding to the computed dimensions of the image. The spread values are set with em so that they are relative to the avatar size. And that works because we set the list's font-size to --avatar-size.

Bonus trick #2 is using the general sibling combinator (~) so that on hover or :focus-within of an li, all linked images that follow animate over to reveal more of the hovered avatar. If the number of avatars will cause wrapping, you may want to choose a different effect such as changing the layering via z-index.

🔎 Pop open your browser devtools and experiment with changing the --avatar-size value!

CSS for "Smol Avatar List Component"

```plain text
.smol-avatar-list { --avatar-size: 3rem; --avatar-count: 3; display: grid; /* Default to displaying most of the avatar to enable easier access on touch devices, ensuring the WCAG touch target size is met or exceeded */ grid-template-columns: repeat( var(--avatar-count), max(44px, calc(var(--avatar-size) / 1.15)) ); /* `padding` matches added visual dimensions of the `box-shadow` to help create a more accurate computed component size */ padding: 0.08em; font-size: var(--avatar-size); } @media (any-hover: hover) and (any-pointer: fine) { .smol-avatar-list { /* We create 1 extra cell to enable the computed width to match the final visual width */ grid-template-columns: repeat( calc(var(--avatar-count) + 1), calc(var(--avatar-size) / 1.75) ); } } .smol-avatar-list li { width: var(--avatar-size); height: var(--avatar-size); } .smol-avatar-list li:hover ~ li a, .smol-avatar-list li:focus-within ~ li a { transform: translateX(33%); } .smol-avatar-list img, .smol-avatar-list a { display: block; border-radius: 50%; } .smol-avatar-list a { transition: transform 180ms ease-in-out; } .smol-avatar-list img { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.05em #fff, 0 0 0 0.08em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); } .smol-avatar-list a:focus { outline: 2px solid transparent; /* Double-layer trick to work for dark and light backgrounds */ box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.08em #29344B, 0 0 0 0.12em white; }
```

- grid
- layout

Modern CSS has gifted us a series of properties that enable setting up more controlled scrolling experiences. In this demo, you'll find that as you begin to scroll, the middle items "snap" to the center of the scrollable area. Additionally, you are unable to scroll past more than one item at a time.

To align the scroll items, we're using grid and updating the orientation of child items using grid-auto-flow: column. Then the width of the grid children is set using min() which selects the minimum computed value between the options provided. The selected width options in this demo results in a large section of neighboring items being visible in the scrollable area for large viewports, while on smaller viewports the scrollable area is mostly consumed by the current scroll item.

While this is a very cool feature set, use with care! Be sure to test your implementation to ensure its not inaccessible. Test across a variety of devices, and with desktop zoom particularly at levels of 200% and 400% to check for overlap and how a changed aspect ratio affects scroll items. Try it out with a screen reader and make sure you can navigate to all content.

Note: Have caution when attempting to mix fullscreen scroll snap slideshows followed by normal flow content. This can damage the overall scrolling experience and even prevent access to content. Fullscreen scroll areas are also prone to issues for users of high desktop zoom due to high risk of overlapping content as the aspect ratio changes. In addition, fullscreen versions that use y mandatory result in "scroll hijacking" which can be frustrating to users.

Also - you may have a pleasant smooth scroll experience on a touchpad or magic mouse. But mouse users who rely on interacting with the scroll bar arrows or use a click wheel can have a jarring experience. This is due to browser and OS inconsistencies in handling the snapping based on input method (an issue was specifically reported for this demo using Chrome and Edge on PC).

CSS for "Smol Scroll Snap"

```plain text
.smol-scroll-snap { /* Set up container positioning */ display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; grid-gap: 1.5rem; /* Enable overflow along our scroll axis */ overflow-x: auto; /* Define axis and scroll type, where `mandatory` means any scroll attempt will cause a scroll to the next item */ scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; padding: 0 0 1.5rem; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; } .smol-scroll-snap > * { width: min(45ch, 60vw); /* Choose how to align children on scroll */ scroll-snap-align: center; /* Prevents scrolling past more than one child */ scroll-snap-stop: always; }
```

## Smol Focus Styles

Section titled Smol Focus Styles

- utility

Focus styles are incredibly important for the accessibility of your application. But, it can be difficult to manage them across changing contexts.

The following solution takes advantage of custom properties and :is() to set reasonable defaults for interactive elements. Then, individual instances can override each setting by simply providing an alternate value for the custom property.

This solution sets currentColor as the outline-color which works in many contexts. One that it might not is for buttons, in which case you could update --outline-color to use the same color as the button background, for example.

Additionally, this demonstrates one of the newly available CSS pseudo-class selectors: focus-visible. This selector is intended to only display focus styles when the browser detects that they should be visible (you may encounter the term "heuristics"). For now, we've setup some fallbacks so that a focus style is presented even when a browser doesn't support :focus-visible quite yet.

Note: Due to using :focus-visible, you may not see focus styles on the links and buttons unless you tab to them.

CSS for "Smol Focus Styles"

```plain text
/* For "real-world" usage, you do not need to scope these custom properties */ .smol-focus-styles :is(a, button, input, textarea, summary) { /* Using max() ensures at least a value of 2px, while allowing the possibility of scaling relative to the component */ --outline-size: max(2px, 0.08em); --outline-style: solid; --outline-color: currentColor; } /* Base :focus styles for fallback purposes */ .smol-focus-styles :is(a, button, input, textarea, summary):focus { outline: var(--outline-size) var(--outline-style) var(--outline-color); outline-offset: var(--outline-offset, var(--outline-size)); } /* Final :focus-visible styles */ .smol-focus-styles :is(a, button, input, textarea):focus-visible { outline: var(--outline-size) var(--outline-style) var(--outline-color); outline-offset: var(--outline-offset, var(--outline-size)); } /* Remove base :focus styles when :focus-visible is available */ .smol-focus-styles :is(a, button, input, textarea):focus:not(:focus-visible) { outline: none; } /* Demonstration of customizing */ .smol-focus-styles li:nth-of-type(2) a { --outline-style: dashed; } .smol-focus-styles input { --outline-color: red; } .smol-focus-styles textarea { --outline-size: 0.25em; --outline-style: dotted; --outline-color: green; } .smol-focus-styles li:nth-of-type(4) button { font-size: 2.5rem; }

## Smol Visited Styles

Section titled Smol Visited Styles

- utility

The :visited pseudo class is very unique because of the potential to be exploited in terms of user's privacy. To resolve this, browser makers have limited which CSS styles are allowed to be applied using :visited.

A key gotcha is that styles applied via :visited will always use the parent's alpha channel - meaning, you cannot use rgba to go from invisible to visible, you must change the whole color value. So, to hide the initial state, you need to be able to use a solid color, such as the page or element's background color.

As usual - this demo has bonus techniques and properties! Note the way we're updating the order of the visited indicator using flexbox. And, we're using some newly supported properties to change the color, position, and style of the link underline.

Plus, we're using fit-content again but as a value of width this time and not as a function. This means it will expand to the equivalent of max-width but not exceed the available width, preventing overflow.

CSS for "Smol Visited Styles"

```plain text
ul.smol-visited-styles { --color-background: #fff; --color-accent: green; display: grid; grid-gap: 0.5rem; width: fit-content; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; background-color: var(--color-background); border: 1px solid var(--color-accent); } .smol-visited-styles a { display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; justify-content: flex-end; color: #222; text-decoration-color: var(--color-accent); text-decoration-style: dotted; text-underline-offset: 0.15em; } .smol-visited-styles a span { margin-right: 0.25em; /* Remove from normal document flow which excludes it from receiving the underline ✨ */ float: left; } .smol-visited-styles a span::after { content: "✔"; color: var(--color-background); } .smol-visited-styles a:visited span::after { color: var(--color-accent); }

## Smol Document Styles

Section titled Smol Document Styles

- layout

In 55 smol lines of CSS, we've created a set of reasonable document styles that is just enough to produce a responsive, easily readable document given the use of semantic HTML. Thanks to flexbox, viewport units, and clamp, it's flexible for variable document lengths. The newly supported :is() deserves the most credit in terms of reducing lines of code.

While lines of code (short or long) certainly doesn't automatically mean "quality", this demo shows that for a simple project you may not need a framework when a little dash of carefully applied CSS will do!

In fact - it's a great starting point to expand from to use the other smol techniques 😉

## Smol Transitions

Section titled Smol Transitions

- utility

This set of performant CSS transition utility classes include CSS custom properties for scaling the transition property and duration. We're doing a few things in this demo that you may want to keep in mind if you use them.

First, we're triggering the transition of the child elements on :hover of the parent. The reason for this is that for transitions that move the element, it could end up moving out from under the mouse and causing a flicker between states. The rise transition is particularly in danger of that behavior.

Second, we wrap our effect class in a media query check for prefers-reduced-motion: reduce that instantly jumps the transition to the final state. This is to comply with the request for reduced motion by effectively disabling the animated part of the transition.

CSS for "Smol Transitions"

```plain text
.smol-transitions > * { --transition-property: transform; --transition-duration: 180ms; transition: var(--transition-property) var(--transition-duration) ease-in-out; } .rise:hover > * { transform: translateY(-25%); } .rotate:hover > * { transform: rotate(15deg); } .zoom:hover > * { transform: scale(1.1); } .fade > * { --transition-property: opacity; --transition-duration: 500ms; } .fade:hover > * { opacity: 0; } @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .smol-transitions > * { --transition-duration: 0.01ms; } }

Anchor links have had quite an evolution over the years. Have you checked if your implementation is as accessible as it can be? This demo starts with an accessible DOM structure as researched by Amber Wilson, and then uses CSS grid to position the anchor link element.

Note: When using grid or flexbox to change the visual order vs the DOM order, always be cautious of breaking expectations in visual focus order. In this case, we know the headline itself will not contain a link and so we are still able to maintain a visually logical focus order.

This demo also features an old pseudo class that is often forgotten which is :target. Go ahead - click the anchor in this demo or across this site. Thanks to :target coupled with ::before, you'll be greeted with a friendly message to help identify the target of the hashed URL.

Finally, we've also included scroll-margin-top which adds margin only to an active page target. In other words, upon clicking an anchor link or visiting the site with a hashed URL, the scroll point will be above the target by the value of scroll-margin-top (not yet available in Safari).

Bonus: Notice the properties set on :focus to adjust the outline position with outline-offset. And check out :hover to see text-underline-offset used to adjust the position of the underline.

```plain text
.smol-article-anchor { display: grid; grid-template-columns: min-content auto; position: relative; margin-top: 2em; /* You could pull this property out and generalize it under the selector `[id]` as it won't affect flow layout or regular margins */ scroll-margin-top: 2em; } .smol-article-anchor:target::before { content: "Is it me you're looking for?"; position: absolute; font-size: .9rem; top: -1.25rem; left: 0; font-style: italic; color: currentColor; } .smol-article-anchor a { grid-row-start: 1; align-self: start; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1; /* We're using `transform` vs. margins */ transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(25%); text-decoration: none; /* Be sure to check that your own colors still meet or exceed 4.5:1 contrast when using lowering opacity */ opacity: 0.75; } .smol-article-anchor a:hover { text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.25em; opacity: 1; } .smol-article-anchor a:focus { outline: 2px solid currentColor; outline-offset: 0.15em; } /* Visually hidden while remaining accessible to assistive tech like screen readers */ .smol-article-anchor-hidden { width: 0; height: 0; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; }

- utility

Support for ::marker is now available across all modern browsers! This pseudo-selector allows customizing the "bullet" for unordered lists and the numeral for ordered lists without other pseudo element hacks.

Note: ::marker only allows a select few properties to be modified including animation-*, color, content, direction, font-*, transition-*, unicode-bidi, and white-space.

The use of ::marker is a great progressive enhancement that can be used safely without any special consideration since the default experience should always acceptable.

Bonus: Check out how the emoji are being inserted thanks to the content property's ability to access custom data attributes! (This appears not yet supported for ::marker in Safari)
