This Hacker News [comment by GuB-42](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42823876) intrigued me:

> With ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner) sequences you could in theory encode an unlimited amount of data in a single emoji.

Is it really possible to encode arbitrary data in a single emoji?

**tl;dr:** yes, although found an approach without ZWJ. In fact, you can encode data in _any_ unicode character. This sentence has a hidden message󠅟󠅘󠄐󠅝󠅩󠄜󠄐󠅩󠅟󠅥󠄐󠅖󠅟󠅥󠅞󠅔󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅕󠄐󠅘󠅙󠅔󠅔󠅕󠅞󠄐󠅝󠅕󠅣󠅣󠅑󠅗󠅕󠄐󠅙󠅞󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅕󠄐󠅤󠅕󠅨󠅤󠄑. (Try pasting it into [this decoder](https://emoji.paulbutler.org/?mode=decode))

## Some background

Unicode represents text as a sequence of _codepoints_, each of which is basically just a number that the Unicode Consortium has assigned meaning to. Usually, a specific codepoint is written as `U+XXXX`, where `XXXX` is a number represented as uppercase hexadecimal.

For simple latin-alphabet text, there is a one-to-one mapping between Unicode codepoints and characters that appear on-screen. For example, `U+0067` represents the character `g`.

For other writing systems, some on-screen characters may be represented by multiple codepoints. The character की (in [Devanagari script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari)) is represented by a consecutive pairing of the codepoints `U+0915` and `U+0940`.

## Variation selectors

Unicode designates 256 codepoints as “variation selectors”, named VS-1 to VS-256. These have no on-screen representation of their own, but are used to modify the presentation of the preceeding character.

Most unicode characters do not have variations associated with them. Since unicode is an evolving standard and aims to be future-compatible, variation selectors are supposed to be preserved during transformations, even if their meaning is not known by the code handling them. So the codepoint `U+0067` (“g”) followed by `U+FE01` (VS-2) renders as a lowercase “g”, exactly the same as `U+0067` alone. But if you copy and paste it, the variation selector will tag along with it.

Since 256 is exactly enough variations to represent a single byte, this gives us a way to “hide” one byte of data in any other unicode codepoint.

As it turns out, the [Unicode spec](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/) does not specifically say anything about sequences of multiple variation selectors, except to imply that they should be ignored during rendering.

_See where I’m going with this?_

We can concatenate a sequence of variation selectors together to represent any arbitrary byte string.

For example, let’s say we want to encode the data `[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]`, which represents the text “hello”. We can do this by converting each byte into a corresponding variation selector, and then concatenating them together.

The variation selectors are broken into two ranges of codepoints: the original set of 16 at [`U+FE00 .. U+FE0F`](https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_FE00.html), and remaining 240 at [`U+E0100 .. U+E01EF`](https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_E0100.html) (ranges inclusive).

To convert from a byte to a variation selector, we can do something like this Rust code:

```plain text
fn byte_to_variation_selector(byte: u8) -> char {
    if byte < 16 {
        char::from_u32(0xFE00 + byte as u32).unwrap()
    } else {
        char::from_u32(0xE0100 + (byte - 16) as u32).unwrap()
    }
}

```

To encode a series of bytes, we can concatenate a number of these variation selectors after a base character.

```plain text
fn encode(base: char, bytes: &[u8]) -> String {
    let mut result = String::new();
    result.push(base);
    for byte in bytes {
        result.push(byte_to_variation_selector(*byte));
    }
    result
}

```

Then to encode the bytes `[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]`, we can run:

```plain text
fn main() {
    println!("{}", encode('😊', &[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]));
}

```

Which outputs

```plain text
😊󠅘󠅕󠅜󠅜󠅟

```

It just looks like a regular emoji, but try pasting it into [the decoder](https://emoji.paulbutler.org/?mode=decode).

If we instead use the debug formatter, we see what’s going on:

```plain text
fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", encode('😊', &[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]));
}

```

This prints:

```plain text
"😊\u{e0158}\u{e0155}\u{e015c}\u{e015c}\u{e015f}"

```

This reveals the characters that were “hidden” in the original output.

## Decoding

Decoding is similarly straightforward.

```plain text
fn variation_selector_to_byte(variation_selector: char) -> Option<u8> {
    let variation_selector = variation_selector as u32;
    if (0xFE00..=0xFE0F).contains(&variation_selector) {
        Some((variation_selector - 0xFE00) as u8)
    } else if (0xE0100..=0xE01EF).contains(&variation_selector) {
        Some((variation_selector - 0xE0100 + 16) as u8)
    } else {
        None
    }
}

fn decode(variation_selectors: &str) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    for variation_selector in variation_selectors.chars() {
        if let Some(byte) = variation_selector_to_byte(variation_selector) {
            result.push(byte);
        } else if !result.is_empty() {
            return result;
        }
        // note: we ignore non-variation selectors until we have
        // encountered the first one, as a way of skipping the "base
        // character".
    }

    result
}

```

To use it:

```plain text
use std::str::from_utf8;

fn main() {
    let result = encode('😊', &[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]);
    println!("{:?}", from_utf8(&decode(&result)).unwrap()); // "hello"
}

```

Note that the base character does not need to be an emoji – the treatment of variation selectors is the same with regular characters. It’s just more fun with emoji.

## Can this be abused?

To be clear, this is an abuse of unicode and you shouldn’t do it. If your mind is wandering to practical use cases for this, shut it down.

That said, I can think of a couple of nefarious ways this could be (ab)used:

### 1. Sneaking data past human content filters

Since data encoded this way are invisible once rendered, a human moderator or reviewer will not know they are there.

### 2. Watermarking text

There are techniques for using subtle variations in text to “watermark” a message, so that if it is sent to a number of people and then leaked, it’s possible to trace it to the original recipient. Variation selector sequences are a way to do this that survives most copy/pastes and allows arbitrary data density. You could go so far as to watermark _every single character_ if you wanted to.
