## Working with JSON data

SQLite ships with a JSON extension that lets you store and query JSON documents directly in tables. You can keep your schema flexible while still using SQL to slice and dice structured data.

Example: extracting fields from a JSON column:

```plain text
CREATE TABLE events (
  id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  payload TEXT NOT NULL -- JSON
);

SELECT
  json_extract(payload, '$.user.id')   AS user_id,
  json_extract(payload, '$.action')    AS action,
  json_extract(payload, '$.metadata')  AS metadata
FROM events
WHERE json_extract(payload, '$.action') = 'login';
```

You can also create indexes on JSON expressions, making queries over semi-structured data surprisingly fast.

## Full-text search with FTS5

SQLite’s FTS5 extension turns it into a capable full-text search engine. Instead of bolting on an external search service, you can keep everything in a single database file.

Example: building a simple search index:

```plain text
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts5(
  title,
  body,
  tokenize = "porter"
);

INSERT INTO docs (title, body) VALUES
  ('SQLite Guide', 'Learn how to use SQLite effectively.'),
  ('Local-first Apps', 'Why local storage and sync matter.');

SELECT rowid, title
FROM docs
WHERE docs MATCH 'local NEAR/5 storage';
```

You get ranking, phrase queries, prefix searches, and more—without leaving SQLite or managing a separate service.

## Analytics with window functions and CTEs

SQLite supports common table expressions (CTEs) and window functions, which unlock a whole class of analytical queries that used to require heavier databases.

Example: computing running totals with a window function:

```plain text
SELECT
  user_id,
  created_at,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id
    ORDER BY created_at
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total
FROM payments
ORDER BY user_id, created_at;
```

Combine this with CTEs and you can build surprisingly rich reports and dashboards on top of a single SQLite file.

## Strict tables and better typing

SQLite is famous (or infamous) for its flexible typing model. Modern SQLite adds `STRICT` tables, which enforce type constraints much more like PostgreSQL or other traditional databases.

Example: defining a strict table:

```plain text
CREATE TABLE users (
  id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email     TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_active INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
) STRICT;
```

With strict tables, invalid types are rejected at insert time, making schemas more predictable and reducing subtle bugs—especially in larger codebases.

## Generated columns for derived data

Generated columns let you store expressions as virtual or stored columns, keeping derived data close to the source without duplicating logic across your application.

Example: a normalized search field:

```plain text
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name  TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name   TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name   TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    trim(first_name || ' ' || last_name)
  ) STORED
);

CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_full_name ON contacts(full_name);
```

Now every insert or update keeps `full_name` in sync automatically, and you can index and query it efficiently.

## Write-ahead logging and concurrency

Write-ahead logging (WAL) is a journaling mode that improves concurrency and performance for many workloads. Readers don’t block writers, and writers don’t block readers in the common case.

Enabling WAL is a single pragma call:

```plain text
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
```

For desktop apps, local-first tools, and small services, WAL mode can dramatically improve perceived performance while keeping SQLite’s simplicity and reliability.
