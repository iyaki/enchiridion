   The Tailscale logo

I’ve been using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for around four years to connect my disparate devices, servers and apps together. I wanted to talk a bit about how I use it, some cool features you might not know about, and some stumbling blocks I encountered.

I’m not sure Tailscale needs an introduction for the likely audience of this blog, but I’ll give one anyway. Tailscale is basically a WireGuard[[1]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn1) orchestration service, with lots of nice features sprinkled on top. It’s a subscription product, but it has an insanely generous free tier that covers basically anything you’d ever want to do as an individual. They also open source all their client software, and there’s a third party control server implementation called [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) if you want to avoid the hosted system entirely.

### Basic connectivity

At its core, Tailscale lets you easily connect from one device to another, even if they’re not directly exposed to the Internet. You install the Tailscale client wherever you like (on your phone, computer, servers, Raspberry Pi, etc), authenticate the machine with the control server, and it can then talk to all the other machines on the tailnet using their private Tailscale IP addresses.

That isn’t anything revolutionary: it’s the basic premise behind VPNs. But Tailscale makes it so easy. You don’t have to bother with any networking configuration. You don’t have to distribute keys. You just install the client[[2]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn2), and login.

For example, my [home automation service](https://chameth.com/home-automation-without-megacorps/) runs on a Raspberry Pi that sits behind two different routers. I installed Tailscale on it[[3]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn3), logged in, and immediately I could SSH into it from my computer or my phone even when they’re on different networks.

Speaking of SSH, Tailscale has special support for it whereby it handles any incoming connection to port 22 from the Tailscale network, and deals with authentication itself. No public keys or passwords: if you’re logged into Tailscale you can be logged into the machine. This is particularly handy when you SSH from a phone, as proper credential management is a bit of a nightmare there.

Exposing entire machines is just the start, though. If you run multiple services on the machine you need to remember which port they’re all on. Yuck. Instead, you can expose individual services as their own node on a tailnet. There are lots of options for doing so: there’s [an official Docker image](https://tailscale.com/kb/1282/docker), a [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/tsnet), and many third-party tools (such as my own [Centauri](https://github.com/csmith/centauri) and [tsp](https://github.com/csmith/tsp)).

### Not just a VPN

Exposing individual services wouldn’t be much use if you still had to remember their IP addresses. For a long time I manually added DNS entries for Tailscale nodes, allowing me to connect to `http://grafana/` instead of `http://100.73.190.100`. Recently I switched to Tailscale’s [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns), though, which takes care of that for you. Every machine on the tailnet gets an automatic DNS entry based on its name.

I initially shied off of this because it changes the DNS resolver on every machine it’s installed on, and it all seemed a bit too “magic” for me[[4]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn4). I got fed up with manually adding DNS entries though, so I spent a bit of time learning about it and got over my knee-jerk “what on earth is going on?!” reaction. The DNS controls also let you force a specific upstream DNS server. I use [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) everywhere, so having Tailscale automatically configure this for me on all my devices was a bonus[[5]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn5).

As well as the short names, you can resolve nodes on the tailnet using a slightly longer form: `machine.your-tailnet.ts.net`. The “your-tailnet” bit is randomly generated, and you can reroll it in the control panel to find a fun one. But why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick? Because Tailscale can make these addresses globally routable, and issue TLS certs for them too.

Say you’re developing something on your local machine, and want to get feedback from someone. You can use Tailscale’s “funnel” feature to expose it publicly:

With no other options, this will expose the service over HTTPS on port 443. You can then invite people to visit `https://machine.your-tailnet.ts.net` and they’ll connect through to port 8080 on your machine. They don’t even need Tailscale installed. I don’t use this terribly often, but it’s a great quality-of-life improvement on the occasions I do want to share something.

Tailscale also has a “serve” command, which does much the same but only exposes it over your tailnet. This is how you’d use the Tailscale Docker image to expose a normal service onto your tailnet, but it’s also useful for similar development scenarios. Occasionally I’ll want to test something on my phone, and rather than make sure it’s connected to the right Wi-Fi network, recompiling the app to not bind to localhost, figuring out my machine’s IP, and so on, and so forth, I just run `tailscale serve` and access it over Tailscale.

### Authentication, two ways

One of my minor frustrations with Tailscale was how cumbersome the authentication process was. I logged in using GitHub, and every time I tried to login to Tailscale, I had to bounce through the GitHub OAuth flow and then select which organisation I wanted to use. Even if I was logged in to GitHub, it still shows the permission page every time. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s definitely not smooth. This is what it looks like:

   Logging in to Tailscale with a GitHub account

![image](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/auth.png)

Tailscale have since added the ability to sign in with a custom OIDC provider, so I set up a [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) instance, and my login flow now looks like this:

   Logging in to Tailscale with KeyCloak as an OIDC provider

![image](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/keycloak.png)

It’s a significantly shorter flow, and because KeyCloak is entirely under my control I can configure how long I stay logged in for. It also reduces my reliance on third parties: if GitHub goes down, or decides to ban my account[[6]](https://chameth.com/how-i-use-tailscale/#fn6) or something, I can still access Tailscale.

That’s how you log in to Tailscale, but Tailscale can also assist with logging in to other services. If you connect to a HTTP service over Tailscale, it will add in the following headers:

```plain text
Tailscale-User-Login: alice@example.com
Tailscale-User-Name: Alice Smith
Tailscale-User-Profile-Pic: https://example.com/photo.jpg

```

A lot of software has support for accepting login credentials provided by a reverse proxy, which is basically what’s happening here. For example, I run a Grafana instance that’s only exposed over Tailscale. Its config (set in environment variables) is:

```plain text
GF_USERS_AUTO_ASSIGN_ORG: "true"
GF_USERS_AUTO_ASSIGN_ORG_ROLE: "Admin"
GF_AUTH_PROXY_ENABLED: "true"
GF_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER_NAME: "Tailscale-User-Login"
GF_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER_PROPERTY: "email"
GF_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_SIGN_UP: "true"

```

So anyone who presents a `Tailscale-User-Login` header gets an admin account created with that as their e-mail address. It’s super convenient, but obviously make sure it’s _only_ exposed via Tailscale if you do that!

Other services I run that support this include [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#auth-proxy-header) (an RSS reader), [Jelu](https://bayang.github.io/jelu-web/configuration/#configuring-proxy-authentication) (a book tracker), [Linkding](https://linkding.link/options/#ld_enable_auth_proxy) (a bookmark manager), and [Seafile](https://manual.seafile.com/latest/config/remote_user/) (a file storage system). If you’re hosting something yourself, look out for “proxy auth” or “remote users” in the documentation or configuration. It’s amazingly convenient to be able to access things without entering credentials.

### ACLs, tags and mistakes

For a long time I didn’t bother with any kind of ACLs within my Tailscale network. Every machine could access every other machine. Then one day a thought hit me. The default Tailscale SSH config re-prompts you for user authentication, but I’d disabled that by tweaking the config… That means anyone with access to any of my machines (or who managed to get Tailscale credentials out of one of my apps) would be able to SSH into anywhere else on my network. Even as root! Compromising a small bit of my network would immediately lead to a complete take-over. What’s the point in defence-in-depth if you roll out a red carpet over the drawbridge for any attackers?

The first and most obvious fix for this was to restrict root access over SSH. I changed my Tailscale ACL to prompt for reauthentication for root access, but still allow regular SSH unprompted:

```plain text
{
  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src":    ["autogroup:member"],
      "dst":    ["autogroup:self"],
      "users":  ["autogroup:nonroot"],
    },
    {
      "action": "check",
      "src":    ["autogroup:member"],
      "dst":    ["autogroup:self"],
      "users":  ["root"],
    },
  ],
}

```

This still didn’t sit right with me, though. Why should a random webserver be able to (theoretically) SSH into my desktop computer unchallenged? Tailscale allows you to do more advanced ACLs by applying tags to devices. I dutifully created a bunch of tags, and went through and tagged every device: `user`, `server`, `app`, `container`, and so on. This, it turns out, was a mistake. I could no longer SSH to anywhere. If I’d read the docs properly, I might have noticed how they describe tags:

> 

By applying a nice `user` tag to all of my devices (computer, phone, tablet and so on), I’d effectively removed my own identity from them. They no longer counted for the `autogroup:member` source in the SSH config. Whoops. And it’s not easy to fix either:

> 

So I’d have to remove all the affected devices, then re-add them. At the time I wanted to roll back _all_ the tags, which would mean reconnecting dozens of nodes to the Tailnet. I did end up doing that, but I also took it as an opportunity to switch to KeyCloak as I mentioned earlier. Setting everything up again was a bit less painful when it wasn’t just correcting a dumb mistake.

I now have a much more sensible tag setup: servers are tagged `server`, apps are tagged `app`, and a few special apps are tagged `integration`. I then use Tailscale’s grants to limit access within the tailnet:

```plain text
{
  "grants": [
    {
      // Users can access everything
      "src": ["autogroup:member"],
      "dst": ["*"],
      "ip":  ["*"],
    },
    {
      // Servers and integrations can access integrations and apps
      "src": ["tag:server", "tag:integration"],
      "dst": ["tag:integration", "tag:app"],
      "ip":  ["*"],
    },
  ],
}

```

This stops anyone but a user device from accessing servers, and stops plain apps from accessing anything at all. So for example my Grafana instance is tagged as an `app`; it doesn’t connect out over Tailscale for anything, it only exposes its interface over Tailscale. My home automation software is tagged as an `integration`, as it reaches out to other services over Tailscale (e.g., to push metrics it receives from devices).

You could go even further and limit which specific machines talk to which others, but I think this tier system sets reasonable boundaries for my use without getting too much in the way.

### Even more

There are lots of other cool features offered by Tailscale that I’ve not covered: exit nodes (allowing you to route normal Internet traffic over Tailscale; very handy when you’re behind a router you don’t trust, or if you want to appear as being in another country for totally legitimate reasons); Tailscale lock (a system where existing nodes have to verify any new ones, guarding against both unauthorised access and Tailscale themselves inserting nodes into your network); file sharing, and more I’ve probably forgotten.

As I mentioned before, an awful lot is available on the free personal plan. It’s definitely worth checking out if you manage servers, or self-host anything. I can’t imagine going back to managing servers and private apps without Tailscale, and I’m excited to see what else they do going forward.
